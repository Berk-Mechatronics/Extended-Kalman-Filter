Extended Kalman Filter
This repository contains exercises and implementations related to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for robotics applications. The main focus is on theoretical considerations, with Exercise 1 providing an insightful overview. It explains the EKF as an implementation of the Bayes Filter and details the normal distributions associated with its probability density functions. The components of EKF, such as µt, Σt, g, Gt, h, Ht, Qt, Rt, and Kt, are thoroughly explained, emphasizing their roles in mobile robotics applications. Additionally, Exercise 2 involves deriving the Jacobian matrix Gt for the noise-free motion function g in a differential drive robot scenario, with the implementation of the prediction step in the EKF. Exercise 3 delves into the derivation of the Jacobian matrix Ht for the noise-free measurement function h of a range-only sensor, along with the implementation of the EKF correction step. These exercises and implementations serve as valuable resources for understanding and working with EKF in robotic systems.
